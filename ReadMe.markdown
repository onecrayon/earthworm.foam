Earthworm is an [Espresso][esp] theme using a light-on-dark color
scheme.

To install, move the file Earthworm.css into your Espresso themes folder:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Themes/

Relaunch Espresso, and select the theme in the program preferences to use it.

Earthworm is still under development, and currently only explicitly supports
HTML, CSS, and PHP.

Earthworm is released under an MIT license, so please feel free to contribute
or port it elsewhere. You can also file feature
requests or bug reports in the [Issues tab][issues] or [email me][email].

Earthworm is inspired by [this image][img] from the PHP article on Wikipedia.
If you happen to know what theme that image is based on, please let me
know.  I would love to give credit where credit is due.
